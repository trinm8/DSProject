## Architecture
![alt text](https://github.com/trinm8/DSProject/blob/main/img/Architecture.png?raw=true)  
 The architecture of my services might look a bit like a mess in this graph but its pretty straightforward. At the top we have the UI service which handles the rendering of the templates and sending out the requests to make sure the right data is shown. Following that we have the "middle" layer which handles the different components of the site, these are mainly a communication layer between the front end service and the individual services. For example, if we would like to see a page with all the matches in our database, the UI service would send out a request to our matches service who will then on his turn send out a request to the matches database. This data will then travel back up the chain until its rendered by the UI service. These middle services might sometimes process this data on their own to satisfy the recieved request, for example when we ask the matches request for the division rankings it will prepare a ranking in advance rather then just giving the raw data of all the played matches and making the UI service figure it all out. The middle layer services also sometimes communicates between themselves, this is mostly to validate recieved data i.e. checking if a recieved ID is valid or not. The only exception to this is the CRUD operations in the admin interface which communicates directly with the database services with flask-admin.
 
### Design Choises
The main reason why everything is structured like this is because I followed the tutorial given to us and extended that structure throughtout the project. This also why the referee service is so isolated from the rest because I set it up at the beginning but ended up never really using it. The databases are again sepaterated because of the tutorial but are indexed like this because in the assignment they were listed in this way so I decided to do it like that aswell.
